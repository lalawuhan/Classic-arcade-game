# Arcade Game Project: Frogger Clone

This game is part of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program. The Arcade Game clone is inspired by the game Frogger. The mission is to lead the player to the water using the arrow keys. Easy peasy, right? But you must watch out for the ladybugs: if the hero and the enemies collide, you must start again.
